## Configuration

The goal during development has been to provide an flexible and simple way to configure the extension to adapt it to your projects' needs.

  - Open `Code` -> `Preferences` -> `Settings`
  - Go to `Extensions` -> `Translation Keys Lookup`

The following settings are available:

| Setting Name | Default value | Description|
